# Task 1
# Titanic Survival prediction

I used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, 
gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

# Task 3

# Iris Flower Classification Project
Machine Learning Model to Classify Iris Species

ðŸ”¹ Project Goal: Built a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset: The famous Iris dataset containing 150 samples with four features:

sepal_length, sepal_width

petal_length, petal_width

# Task 4 
# SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. 
I have explored multiple linear regression and random forest to come up with the model that best predicts sales.
