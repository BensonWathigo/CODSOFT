# Task 1
# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

I used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, 
gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

# Task 3

# Iris Flower Classification Project
Machine Learning Model to Classify Iris Species

🔹 Project Goal: Built a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

🔹 Dataset: The famous Iris dataset containing 150 samples with four features:

sepal_length, sepal_width

petal_length, petal_width
